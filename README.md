# borderless inverted cursors
borderless, inverted (negative color of the background) cursor for windows (.cur)  

## why I made this
windows default inverted curser skins all have black border / outline, which is INBALANCE under the 'color-invert' context.  
I made this for people with obsession, for example me.  

## made with  
Greenfish Icon Editor Pro 4.1 

## trick
windows treat ARGB(x00ffffff) color as invert color for cursors.
