# borderless inverted cursors
borderless, inverted (negative color of the background) cursor for windows (.cur)  

![pointer](/Full%20Negative/pointer_negative.cur "pointer")


## why I made this
windows default inverted curser skins all have black border / outline, which is INBALANCE under the 'color-invert' context.  
I made this for people with obsession, for example me.  

## recommend settings
- Settings > Accessibility > Mouse pointer and touch > Mouse pointer > Size = 2
- Personalization > Themes > Mouse cursor > [set xxx.cur for each state]

## made with  
Greenfish Icon Editor Pro 4.1 

## trick
windows treat ARGB(x00ffffff) color as invert color for cursors.
